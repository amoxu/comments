and cloud-storage service safety certification of various cloud providers. Therefore,
this line of defense is very solid, and reliable cloud providers also protect the
authority of the security of the system. The solution was through system simulation
and verification in the LINUX environment, and the information dispersal algorithms
were compared.

In contrasting schema-based dispersal algorithm with information dispersal
algorithms, the inputs of the experiments are: data files with User structure (Fig. 2),
the length is 1M, n = [5, 15]; the broken sub-unit of schema-based dispersal algorithm
is file, and its basic granularity is table; m=n-l in information dispersal algorithms.
Experiments were repeated 10 times averaged to obtain the time-costs of dispersion and reconstruction (Fig. 3).Figures show that the efficiency of the schema-based dispersal algorithm is better than the information dispersal algorithms', and there is a linear relationship between its efficiency and the size of the original data file.

4 Conclusion
Compared with distributed storage, this article creatively proposes a trust-control
architecture based on the concept of cloud storage service. Users no longer have to
worry about the security of cloud storage; it removes the biggest obstacle faced in the
promotion of cloud, and has a great significance to the development of cloud.
