3.3 Evaluating Results
We have successfully tested a pair of Hermitel network adapter with PCI Express 4-lane width directly connecting each other and HermiteII network adapter with PCI Express 8-lane width on the same environment as described in Table 1 and Table 2.Figure 2 shows the result of NetPIPE of HermiteI and HermiteII network adapters in the testing environment described above. NetPIPE started to send from 0 byte message size to 8388611 bytes message size trying to probe the maximal bandwidth. Latency of each pattern was also measured in NetPIPE.
