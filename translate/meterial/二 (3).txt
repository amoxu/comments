3.2 Prerequisites Testing Environment
Figure 1 shows the connecting method. We directly connected the client] (CNl) and client2 (CN2) through a specific PCI Express cable. Each client equipped with AKIBSYSTEMS HermiteI 4-lane (x4) or HermiteII 8-lane (x8) network adapters. All data streams generated by the applications directly ran from peer to peer. The switch was not applied in this paper.
